            <p>
                Monday was an interesting day to say the least, it started off with me eating a donut. Then I had to complete my list of tasks as above. After that, I proceed to go pay my credit card which was a decent amount of money and I slowly watched the money leave my bank account and started to <em>cry a bit</em>, just kidding, or am I? (dun-dun) Then I had to go to work which is always an experience and you know its cool and all but can be time-consuming sometimes. However, after work and classes, I was able to go eat Canes, which is one of my favorite foods! Then I went to bed and it was time to have some dreams!

                    Tuesday was another <i>great day</i> and it started it with a nice Berry Smoothie from The Market at 7th. Then I had to complete my list of tasks as above. My homework took a long portion of my day. As well as, having class the whole day, I was just a super busy person. <br> After, I had finished classes and homework, I did have some free time. I used the time to go on a run and got a 7 minute mile. I am pretty impressed with myself to say the least. Then I was deliever tacos by my lover and the tacos were great! After all that, it was time to hit the sheets.

Then I headed to the doctor's office, which was quite time consuming. My hlabs took a long portion of my day. <br> After, I had finished classes and lab work, I did have some free time. I used the time to go to El Pollo Loco and treat myself to a burrito. That burrito was quite delicious and I was satisfied. After a long day of work, I settled down and watched some anime with my favorite person, then proceed to fall asleep.
